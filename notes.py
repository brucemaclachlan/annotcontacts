#The atom name is the third item in the record. Notice that the first one or two characters of the atom name consists of the chemical symbol for the atom type. All the atom names beginning with C are carbon atoms; N indicates a nitrogen and O indicates oxygen. In amino acid residues, the next character is the remoteness indicator code, which is transliterated according to:
#
#α	A
#β	B
#γ	G
#δ	D
#ε	E
#ζ	Z
#η	H
#The next character of the atom name is a branch indicator, if required.
